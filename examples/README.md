Python Examples
==================

These examples are scripts that can be run independently to demonstrate the Rosette API functionality.

Prerequisite: Either run `pip install rosette_api` or run `python setup.py install` in the python top level folder.

Alternatively, you can run all the examples with the command line:
`find -maxdepth 1 -name "*.py" -exec tox -- {} --key api-key --url alternate_url \;`

You can now run your desired _endpoint_.py file to see it in action.
For example, run `python/examples/categories.py` if you want to see the categories
functionality demonstrated.

All files require you to input your Rosette API User Key after --key to run.
For example: `python ping.py --key 1234567890`
All also allow you to input your own service URL if desired.
For example: `python ping.py --key 1234567890 --service_url http://www.myurl.com`
Some (specified below) allow an additional input of either a file (.html or .txt) or a URL with `--file` or `--url`

Each example, when run, prints its output to the console.
